# search-engine-MERN

A book search application built using an Apollo Server, GraphQL API - queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, and an authentication middleware.

It has been refactored as it was previously built with Google Books API and a RESTful API, a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server.
